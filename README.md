# Discord Creep Bot
Python script that logs messages, leaves/joins and downloads any media sent.

## How to use
1. Place the code in a directory where you want the logs saved. Logs are stored in their own auto-generated folders.
2. Replace relevant variables in the first ten lines of code with your preferred IDs. Also, include your bot token at the bottom.
3. Invite bot to server with all permissions/admin.
4. Run. It should work. Hopefully.

## Requirements
DiscordPy...and that's it.
